    <p>	In the State of New York, hate crimes are a crucial problem in the community, and anyone in leadership has yet to find a solution to combat it. In 2019 alone, there were 750 reported hate crimes against Jewish people. The second-biggest reported group in 2019 that had crimes committed against them were anti-Asian crimes, with 238. </p> 

	<p> When people first think of the phrase “hate crimes,” they don’t always think of a particular group. According to CNN, hate crimes in New York are up 76% in New York City compared to 2022. In the visualization below, New York is the top county with 617 reported hate crimes, and these numbers come from the New York State government and the New York Police Department Hate Crimes Task Force (HCTF). </p>

	<p> The HCTF data showed Asian hate crimes were down 32%, and black hate crimes have doubled. Now you might be asking yourself how severe are these hate crimes. How about a teenager on the Upper West Side of Manhattan being accused of threatening six Jewish boys with swords <a href= "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/16/us/hate-crimes-rise-in-new-york-city?"> Point proven. </a> </p>

	<p> To better understand the environment of hate crimes in the younger generation, I spoke to Winnick Hillel Center for Jewish Life’s President Sydney Schroeder. Schroeder, who is from California, has served on Hillel’s leadership board for the past two years and understands the reality that Jewish students face daily. </p>

	<p> “It is extremely disheartening to see that hate crimes are still prevalent in our country, although it is a reality we still face,” said Schroeder. “To me, it shows that antisemitism is alive and well, which is terrifying. I believe that how we combat this is to continue learning about these acts and advocate for our own community as well as other minorities if we see something.” </p>

	<p> Education is the main factor in improving the lives of each and every group of people. Whether they are Jewish, Asian, black, or any other ethnicity, everyone deserves to be treated the same way. Antisemitism, as Schroeder pointed out, is something that people have to look past in their everday life and have not to live their life in fear. </p>

	<p> Even with new changes from Mayor Eric Adams, Hate Crimes will continue as our world is filled with hate. Until real consequences are put in place other than strict jail time, areas such as New York will deal with an ugly challenge: hate crimes. </p>
